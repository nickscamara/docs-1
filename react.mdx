## Sidekick Link
Sidekick Link is a React SDK to help your users connect their accounts to Sidekick.

### 1. Install Sidekick Link
```bash
npm install @psychicdev/link
```

### 2. Import it into your project
```javascript
import { usePsychicLink } from @psychicdev/link
```

### 3. Configure Sidekick Link with your API key and a callback function
Unpack the functions and state variables.
```javascript
const { open, isReady, isLoading, error } = usePsychicLink(publicKey, psychicCallback) 
```
* `open` is a function that opens the Sidekick Link modal to prompt your user to connect their account
* `isReady` is a boolean that indicates whether Sidekick Link is initialized and ready to be shown
* `isLoading` is a boolean that indicates whether your application is still waiting for a connection. `isLoading` will be `true` as long as no window event has been received from the Sidekick Link modal indicating the connection was successful.
* `error` is null, or a string describing why Sidekick Link failed to establish a connection. If `error` is not null, it means something has gone wrong and you should handle the error.
* `publicKey` should be your public API key from Sidekick, which you can get from the [Sidekick dashboard](https://dashboard.getsidekick.ai).
* `psychicCallback` is a callback function that will be called once a connection is successfully established.

### 5. Programatically set a Connection ID
The connection ID should be unique for every user + connection pair. For example, a user with ID `1234` connecting to Notion should have a Connection ID that uniquely identifies the tuple (`1234`, `notion`). Beyond those constraints, a connectionID can be any alphanumeric string.

```javascript
const connectionID = `user12345_notion`
```

### 6. Trigger the modal
Call `open` (or whatever variable that you unpacked it into) with the Connection ID to open the Sidekick Link modal as a new window and initiate the connection flow. You can decide when and how to trigger this flow from your application.
```javascript
<button onClick={() => {
    open(connectionId)
  }} >
  Connect to Notion
</button>
```

### 6. Handle success or errors
If the connection is successful, you can implement the handling logic from the callback provided to `usePsychicLink`. Typically, you'll want to show the user a message saying the connection was sucessful, and send a request to your server to [fetch the Documents]('/pulling-data') from this new connection.

For example:
```javascript
const psychicCallback = (newConnectionId: string) => {
  setNewConnectionId(newConnectionId)
  setSuccessMessage(`Successfully created connection ${newConnectionId}`)
  fetchDocumentsFromServer(newConnectionId)
}
```

### 7. Fetch documents
After your users have connected with Sidekick, you can fetch the documents they've shared by making an API call from your server. See [Pulling Data](('/pulling-data')) for instructions
