Psychic has a [python package](https://pypi.org/project/psychicapi/) that makes it easy to query documents from established connections.

## Installation
The python SDK can be installed by running

```bash
pip install psychicapi
```

## Usage 
[This repo](https://github.com/psychic-api/psychic-langchain-tutorial/tree/main) has an example of how the Psychic Python SDK can be used to sync data into a vector database using LangChain.

### Initialization

```
from psychicapi import ConnectorId, Psychic 
psychic = Psychic(secret_key="secret-key")
```

### Get active connections

```
# Get all active connections and optionally filter by connector id and/or connection id
connections = psychic.get_connections(connector_id=ConnectorId.notion, connection_id=None)
```

### Retrieve documents from a connection

```
docs = psychic.get_documents(ConnectorId.zendesk, "connection-id")
```
