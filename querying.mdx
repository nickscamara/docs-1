## Ways to query
There are 3 ways to query Documents and Conversations after establishing a connection:
1. The `/get-documents` and `/get-conversations` endpoints can be called directly. See [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) for instructions on how to authenticate requests.
2. The [Psychic Python SDK](/python-sdk) can be used to query for Documents and Conversations.
3. Psychic has integrated with LangChain as a [Document Loader](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/document_loaders/examples/psychic.html)
