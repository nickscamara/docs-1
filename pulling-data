## Sidekick Pull



### 1. Get Secret API Key

### 2. Make a request from a server

## Future
* Sidekick Push: define an endpoint to receive data, instead of having to poll for data.
* Webhooks: get pushed data only when changes are detected.
* Incremental syncs: receive only incremental changes to your customers resources, instead of all resources every time.
