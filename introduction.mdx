## ðŸšš What is Sidekick
[Sidekick](https://getsidekick.ai/) is a platform for connecting to SaaS tools like Salesforce, Github, Notion, Zendesk and syncing data between these applications and a vector database. This allows developers to run semantic search queries on data from a variety of sources from a single API endpoint. The results of these queries can be used downstream as context for a LLM prompt, or just as search results delivered to the end user.

You can use the integrations and chunkers from built by the community to get started quickly, or quickly build new integrations and write custom chunkers for different content types based on Sidekick's `DataConnector` and `DataChunker` specs.
