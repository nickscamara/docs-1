## ðŸ”® What is Psychic
[Psychic](https://psychic.dev/) is an open source integration platform to sync and transform unstructured data from SaaS applications like Notion, Slack, Zendesk, Confluence, and Google Drive.

**Psychic is designed for startups that use LLMs in their product.** Instead of building one integration for each data sources, you can build one integration that works for all data sources.

There are 4 parts of the platform
* ðŸª„ **Psychic Link:** A modal that lets end users to connect their data sources with a point and click interface, using OAuth when available. Available as an NPM package for React projects, or as a magic link.
* ðŸª¢ **Psychic Connectors:** Server-side code that makes API calls and handles token management. New integrations are added by implementing a new `DataConnector` in the server-side code.
* ðŸ’ƒ **Psychic Models:** Universal data models that make it possible to transform unstructured data from disparate data sources into a consistent schema before you receive it. Currently `Document` and `Conversation` models are supported.
* ðŸŽ© **Psychic Dashboard:** A front-end for the Psychic platform that makes it easy to manage connections and connect data sources without having to add Link to an existing app.

<Note>Psychic used to be called Sidekick, so if you see any reference to Sidekick in the Docs or libraries, just know it's the same product!</Note>
