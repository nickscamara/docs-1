## What is Sidekick
[Sidekick](https://getsidekick.ai/) is a tool to connect to your customer's SaaS applications like Notion, Zendesk, Confluence, and Google Drive  
You can think of it like Plaid for unstructured text documents. Sidekick is easy to set up - you use it by importing the NPM package and configuring it with your Sidekick API key, which you can get from the [Sidekick dashboard](http://dashboard.getsidekick.ai/). When your users connect their applications, you can view these connections from the dashboard.

Use cases:
* **For AI startups:** Ingest your users' documents into a vector database and use load document chunks into in your prompts.
* **For B2B companies:** Accelerate customer onboarding by letting your customers share documents with you with just a few clicks.

<Note>Sidekick will rebrand to Psychic.dev soon, so if you see any reference to psychic.dev in the Docs or libraries, just know it's the same product!</Note>
