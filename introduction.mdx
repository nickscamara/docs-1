## What is Sidekick
[Sidekick](https://getsidekick.ai/) is a platform for integrating with SaaS tools like Salesforce, Github, Notion, Zendesk and syncing data between these tools and a vector database. This allows developers to run semantic search queries on data from a variety of knowledge bases from a single API endpoint. The results of these searches can be used downstream as context for a LLM prompt, or stand-alone as search results for user queries. 

You can use the integrations and chunkers from built by the community to get started quickly, or quickly build new integrations and write custom chunkers for different content types based on Sidekick's `DataConnector` and `DataChunker` specs.

## Demo
Get an API key to test out a hosted version by [joining our Slack community.](https://sidekick-public.slack.com/). Post in the #api-keys channel to request a new key. You can test it out on some pre-ingested developer docs by tagging the Sidekick bot in the #sidekick-demo channel.
