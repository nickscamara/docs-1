## ðŸ”® What is Psychic
[Psychic](https://psychic.dev/) is an open source integration platform to extract and transform unstructured data from SaaS applications like Notion, Slack, Zendesk, Confluence, and Google Drive.

**Psychic is designed for startups that use LLMs and need to retrieve documents to use as context.** Instead of building one integration for each data sources, you can build one integration that works for all data sources.

There are 3 parts of the platform
* ðŸª„ **Psychic Link:** A modal that lets end users to connect their data sources with a point and click interface, using OAuth. Available as an NPM package for React projects, or as a magic link.
* ðŸª¢ **Universal API:** Abstractions to make it easy to ingest [Document](/api-reference/endpoint/get-documents) and [Conversation]((/api-reference/endpoint/get-conversations)) data from any connected source through a single API endpoint. Filter based on `connector_id` and `account_id`. New integrations can be added by implementing a new `DataConnector` in the server-side code.
* ðŸŽ© **Psychic Dashboard:** A front-end for the Psychic platform that makes it easy to manage connections and connect data sources without having to add Link to an existing app.

The easiest way to get started is with our [quickstart tutorial](/quickstart).
