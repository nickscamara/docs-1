Start by connecting at least one data source from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.psychic.dev/playground) or through [Link](/psychic-link).
You can then query Documents and Conversations from any source though through the Psychic Universal API.

### API Keys
If you're using the cloud version of Psychic, you will need to authorize yourself with a public API key when making requests from a client (e.g. creating new connections for your users) and with a secret API key when making requests from a server (e.g. querying Documents).

These keys can be generated by signing in to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.psychic.dev/api-keys) and going to the API Keys page.

## Bearer Token
Psychic API users the `bearer` auth type for requests. The Bearer token is your secret API key. Refer to the [API Reference](/api-reference/endpoint/get-documents) for examples

```bash
'Authorization': 'Token <secret_api_key>'
```
