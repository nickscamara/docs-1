## ðŸ¦™ Using Psychic as a LlamaIndex Data Loader
Psychic has a native integration with LlamaIndex which makes it easy to use Psychic to connect to live customer data, and load Documents into LlamaIndex for downstream processing.
[This notebook](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/data_connectors/PsychicDemo.html) shows how to use Psychic as a LlamaIndex Data Loader.

An example using `GPTListIndex`:

```python
from llama_index import GPTListIndex, PsychicReader
from IPython.display import Markdown, display

# Get Psychic API key from https://dashboard.psychic.dev/api-keys
psychic_key = "PSYCHIC_API_KEY"
# Connector ID and Account ID are typically set programatically based on the application state.
account_id = "ACCOUNT_ID" 
connector_id = "notion"
documents = PsychicReader(psychic_key=psychic_key).load_data(connector_id=connector_id, account_id=account_id)

os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
index = GPTListIndex.from_documents(documents)
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
response = query_engine.query("What is Psychic's privacy policy?")
display(Markdown(f"<b>{response}</b>"))
```
