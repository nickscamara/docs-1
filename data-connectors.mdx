### Configuration
By default, Sidekick will use our OAuth credentials for Notion to connect to your customer's accounts. If you want to use your own credentials instead, you can following the below steps.

#### Notion OAuth Credentials
In order to connect to use your own OAuth credentials for NOtion, you will need to [create a Notion integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration) and then [make it public](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#how-to-make-an-integration-public).

Once you've made the integration public, you'll be able to access the secrets needed to configure the Notion connector on Sidekick.
The Notion Connector requires the following as input:
- **The Notion OAuth client ID** - This can be found on the Secrets page of your public [Notion integration](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
- **The Notion OAuth client secret** - This can be found on the Secrets page of your public [Notion integration](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
- **The Notion authorization UR**L - This can be found on the Secrets page of your public [Notion integration](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
- **The redirect URI** - this is always `https://dashboard.getsidekick.ai/oauth/redirect`

## [Google Drive](https://app.getsidekick.ai/connectors/gdrive)
Sidekick supports connecting to Google Drive to ingest `.doc`, `.docx` and `.pdf` files from a single folder in Google Drive.

The `connector_id` for Google Drive is `gdrive`.

<Note>The Sidekick app is still waiting on approval from Google, so your users will see a warning when they attempt to connect. You can bypass this by including instructions, or by using your own credentials for a Google app.
