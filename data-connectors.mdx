## [Website](https://app.getsidekick.ai/connectors/website)
Sidekick supports ingesting content from the web by spinning up a headless browser with [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python) and scraping content from a list of web pages. The Connector will extract all elements on every page that matches the CSS selector, convert the contents to text, and ingest the text into a vector database.

### Auth
The Website Connector only works on public websites and does not require authentication or authorization.

### Configuration
The Website Connector requires the following as input:
- Comma-separated list of URLs to scrape
- A [CSS selector](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php)

## [Google Drive](https://app.getsidekick.ai/connectors/google-drive)
Sidekick supports connecting to Google Drive and ingesting Docs files. PDFs, Slides, and other filetypes are not currently supported.

### Auth
The Google Drive Connector uses OAuth 2.0. We are currently awaiting approval from Google so you will see a scary message warning you that our app isn't verified. Just click `Advanced` and then `Proceed` in the bottom left.

### Configuration
The Google Drive Connector requires the following as input:
- The path to the directory with the files you want to ingest, relative to your root Drive. e.g. `SidekickTesting` for a directory in the root Drive, or `someFolder/SidekickTesting` for a nested directory.

## [Notion](https://app.getsidekick.ai/connectors/notion)
Sidekick supports connecting to Notion to ingest pages from a Notion workspace.

### Auth
Connecting to Notion is a bit awkward. You'll have to first follow [these instructions](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration) to create a new Notion integration, and give it access to your workspace. Then, you will need to [add your integration as a connection](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#step-2-share-a-database-with-your-integration) to every Notion page you want to ingest. Finally, find and copy the `Internal Integration Token` from Notion - you will need this to run the Notion connector.

### Configuration
The Notion Connector requires the following as input:
- The `Internal Integration Token` from your Notion integration

Once you click `Connect`, Sidekick will ingest the contents of every page that you've added your integration to in your Notion workspace.

## [Confluence](https://app.getsidekick.ai/connectors/confluence)
Sidekick supports connecting to Confluence and ingesting all pages from a Confluence Space.

### Auth
Connecting to Confluence requires several fields:
- An [API key](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/) for your Confluence account
- The email associated with your Confluence account
- The subdomain of your Confluence account. E.g. for `sidekick.atlassian.net` the subdomain is `sidekick`

### Configuration
The Confluence Connector requires the following as input:
- The ID of the Confluence space you want to ingest. E.g. for `https://sidekick.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SD/overview` the Space ID is `SD`.

Once you click `Connect`, Sidekick will ingest the contents of every page in the Confluence Space you specified.

## [Zendesk](https://app.getsidekick.ai/connectors/zendesk)
Sidekick supports connecting to Zendesk and ingesting all [Articles](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/articles/) in the Zendesk account.

### Auth
Connecting to Confluence requires several fields:
- An [API key](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408889192858-Generating-a-new-API-token) for your Zendesk account
- The email associated with your Zendesk account
- The subdomain of your Zendesk account. E.g. for `sidekick.atlassian.net` the subdomain is `sidekick`

### Configuration
The Zendesk Connector does not require any additional configuration.

Once you click `Connect`, Sidekick will ingest the contents of every Article in the Zendesk account. For accounts with a large number of Articles, this can take a long time.
