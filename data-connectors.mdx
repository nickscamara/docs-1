### Configuration
In order to connect to your users' Notion workspaces, you will need to [create a Notion integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration) and then [make it public](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#how-to-make-an-integration-public).

Once you've made the integration public, you'll be able to access the secrets needed to configure the Notion connector on Sidekick.
The Notion Connector requires the following as input:
- **The Notion OAuth client ID** - This can be found on the Secrets page of your public [Notion integration](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
- **The Notion OAuth client secret** - This can be found on the Secrets page of your public [Notion integration](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
- **The Notion authorization UR**L - This can be found on the Secrets page of your public [Notion integration](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
- **The redirect URI** - this is always `https://dashboard.getsidekick.ai/oauth/redirect`
