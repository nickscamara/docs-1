description: "Psychic supports ingesting Conversations from a Slack channel"
---
The `connector_id` for Slack is `slack`.

## Authorization Type
Psychic uses [OAuth 2.0](https://api.slack.com/legacy/oauth) to connect to Slack workspaces.

## Authorization Flow
End users will need to add the Psychic Slack app to the workspace they want to sync.

## Configuration
The Slack Connector will only retrieve messages from channels where the Psychic Slack App has been added to.

## Synchronization
By default, Conversations can be fetched from the `/get-documents` endpoint on an as-needed basis. 
It's also possible to set up 24 hour syncs by providing a webhook URL in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.psychic.dev/syncs)
