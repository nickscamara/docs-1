## Configuration

### Custom OAuth Credentials
By default, Psychic will use our Confluence OAuth credentials to connect to your customer's accounts. If you want to use your own credentials instead, you can contact us at support@psychic.dev


## Synchronization
By default, Documents can be fetched from the `/get-documents` endpoint on an as-needed basis. 
It's also possible to set up 24 hour syncs by providing a webhook URL in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.psychic.dev/syncs)
