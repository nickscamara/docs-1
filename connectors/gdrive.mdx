The `connector_id` for Notion is `gdrive`.

## Authorization Type
SidekiPsychicck uses Google's [OAuth 2.0 implementation](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect) to connect to Google Drive.

## Authorization Flow
When your users authorize their Google account, they will need to enter the URL of a folder in their Drive that contains the documents they want to sync.

<Note>Psychic is still awaiting approval from Google Cloud for our OAuth application. This means your users will see a warning when connecting their Google account. 
They will need to click on "Advanced" in the warning page to bypass it.</Note>

## Configuration

There are no configuration options for Google Drive at the moment.

## Synchronization
Documents are synced from Google Drive to Psychic on a daily basis. These documents can be fetched from the `/get-documents` endpoint on an as-needed basis. Each call to this endpoint will fetch the most up to date documents from the Google Drive folder associated with the provided `connection_id`.
