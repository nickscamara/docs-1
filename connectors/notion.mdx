## Configuration

### Custom OAuth Credentials
By default, Psychic will use our Notion OAuth credentials to connect to your customer's accounts. If you want to use your own credentials instead, you can following the below steps.

1. [Create a Notion integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration)
2. [Make your integration public](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#how-to-make-an-integration-public).
3. Update the Notion configuration in the [Psychic Dashboard](https://dashboard.psychic.dev/connectors/notion) with the values below.

These can be found on the Secrets page of your public [Notion integration](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
- The Notion OAuth client ID
- The Notion OAuth client secret
- The Notion authorization URL

The redirect URI is always `https://dashboard.psychic.dev/oauth/redirect`.

## Synchronization
Documents are synced from Notion workspaces to Psychic on a daily basis. These documents can be fetched from the `/get-documents` endpoint on an as-needed basis. Each call to this endpoint will fetch the most up to date documents from the Notion workspace associated with the provided `account_id`.
