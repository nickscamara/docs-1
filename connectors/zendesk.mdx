## Configuration

### Custom OAuth Credentials
The Zendesk connector currently requires the end user to know the subdomain of the Zendesk account they want to connect to. They must also have the capability to generate API keys in that account.

Instructions for generating Zendesk API keys can be found [here](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408889192858-Generating-a-new-API-token).

## Synchronization
Zendesk Documents can be fetched as-neded from the `/get-documents` endpoint. 
It's also possible to set up 24 hour syncs by providing a webhook URL in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.psychic.dev/syncs)
