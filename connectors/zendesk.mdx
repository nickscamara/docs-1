The `connector_id` for Zendesk is `zendesk`.

Psychic supports ingesting tickets from Zendesk's [Ticketing APIs](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/introduction/) and articles from [Help Center APIs](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/introduction/)

## Authorization Type
Psychic uses [OAuth 2.0](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/ticketing/working-with-oauth/creating-and-using-oauth-tokens-with-the-api/) to connect to Zendesk.

## Configuration

### Custom OAuth Credentials
1. Go to Apps & Integrations > APIs > Zendesk API > OAuth Clients in your Zendesk Admin Center and click the button titled `Add OAuth Client`.

2. When creating the OAuth client make sure to enable the Psychic redirect url `https://link.psychic.dev/oauth/redirect`. Enter the client ID and client secret from Zendesk and enter them into the Psychic dashboard.

3. By default, your OAuth client will only be able to authenticate **your own Zendesk account**. To authenticate your customers' Zendesk accounts, you will need to submit a request to get your OAuth client approved as a [Global OAuth Client](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/marketplace/building-a-marketplace-app/set-up-a-global-oauth-client/).

## Synchronization
Zendesk Documents can be fetched as-neded from the `/get-documents` endpoint. 
It's also possible to set up 24 hour syncs by providing a webhook URL in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.psychic.dev/syncs)
