The `connector_id` for Dropbox is `dropbox`.

Psychic supports downloading files from Dropbox's [Files APIs](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/documentation#files-download).

## Authorization Type
Psychic uses [OAuth 2.0](https://developers.dropbox.com/oauth-guide) to connect to Dropbox.

## Authorization Flow
TBD

## Configuration

### Custom OAuth Credentials
By default, Psychic will use our Dropbox OAuth credentials. The Dropbox connector does not currently support custom credentials, if you need this [let us know](https://join.slack.com/t/psychicapi/shared_invite/zt-1ty1wz6w0-8jkmdvBpM5kj_Fh30EiCcg).

## Synchronization
Dropbox Documents can be fetched as-neded from the `/get-documents` endpoint. 
It's also possible to set up 24 hour syncs by providing a webhook URL in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.psychic.dev/syncs)
