## ⚡️ Psychic Quickstart
In this tutorial we will set up a Notion connector and use the Psychic Python SDK to fetch documents from a Notion workspace. We will also use LangChain to set up a retrieval service that allows us ask questions about documents in our Notion workspace using the [OpenAI Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions).

### Prerequisites
* Know some python
* An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

### 1. Create an account at [dashboard.psychic.dev](https://dashboard.psychic.dev)
Psychic's cloud version is free to use for up to 5 connections.

### 2. Navigate to the [Playground](https://dashboard.psychic.dev/playground) page to set up a new connection.

The playground is used to connect to your own data, while [Link](/psychic-link) is the easiest way to connect to your users' data.
Enter an `Account ID` that uniquely identifies the user you're connecting on behalf of. In production, the `Account ID` should be unique for every user, and each Connection is a unique tuple of (`Account ID`, `Connector ID`).

Press `Connect` and follow the steps in the Psychic Link modal. Choose which pages from your Notion workspace you want to share.

Refresh the page and go to the `Active Connections` tab to see if the connection with the Account ID you set now appears in the table.

### 3. Test that the connection works
Get your secret API key from the [Psychic dashboard](https://dashboard.psychic.dev/api-keys). 
Then, visit the [API Docs](/api-reference/endpoint/get-documents) and paste your secret key into the `Bearer` field.

Fill in the `connector_id` (`notion`) and the `account_id` you set when making the connection from the Playground.

Click "Send Request". You should see your documents returned in the API response.

This is the most powerful part of the Psychic platform - **you can use this single API to query documents from any number of connections** to Notion, Google Drive, Zendesk, Slack, and more.
Use `connector_id` and `account_id` to filter the documents you want to return.

<Note>Psychic will soon support metadata that will allow you to specify arbitrary properties to filter on beyond just Connector and Account</Note>

## Conclusion
That's it! You've tested what it will be like for your users to connect their Notion pages with Psychic and for you to query them once connected.

## Bonus: Set up ChatGPT for your Notion workspace

It's surprisingly easy to go from a Psychic Connection to using GPT to ask questions over your Notion workspace.
Here's a script that does exactly that in about 30 lines of code.

### Prerequisites
Run the following to install the relevant python packages
```bash
pip install psychicapi langchain openai
```
### ChatGPT for your Notion
Save the following to a new file called `psychic_demo.py`
```python
import sys

from psychicapi import Psychic, ConnectorId
from langchain.docstore.document import Document
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain

# Create a document loader for Notion. We can also load from other connectors e.g. ConnectorId.gdrive
psychic = Psychic(secret_key="PSYCHIC_SECRET_KEY") # Replace this with your secret API key

raw_docs = psychic.get_documents(ConnectorId.notion, "account_id") #replace this with the account_id you set when creating this connection

if raw_docs is None:
    texts = [
		Document(page_content="", metadata={"title": "", "source": ""})
	]
else:
	documents = [
		Document(page_content=doc["content"], metadata={"title": doc["title"], "source": doc["uri"]},)
		for doc in raw_docs
	]

	text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100)
	texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key="OPENAI_API_KEY") # Replace this with your OpenAI API Key
vdb = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings)
query = sys.argv[1]
chain = RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain.from_chain_type(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type="stuff", retriever=vdb.as_retriever())
answer = chain({"question": query}, return_only_outputs=True)
print(answer)
```
In your teminal, run the following command, replacing it with the question you want to ask.

```bash
python psychic_demo.py "some_question"
```
It takes awhile because we're using LangChain to set up a local vector database, but you should get your answer within 30 seconds.

### Next Steps
1. Install the [Psychic Python SDK](/python-sdk) to query your documents in python, instead of making API calls.
2. Install the [Psychic React SDK](/psychic-link) to load the Link component into your own project.
3. Check out the [LangChain tutorial](https://github.com/psychic-api/psychic-langchain-tutorial) to use Psychic to load documents into your LangChain application.
