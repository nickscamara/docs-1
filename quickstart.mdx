## ⚡️ Psychic Quickstart
In this tutorial we will set up a Notion connector, try it out as an end user would experience it, and use it to fetch documents from a Notion workspace.

### 1. Create an account at [dashboard.psychic.dev](https://dashboard.psychic.dev)
Psychic's cloud version is free to use for up to 2 connections.

### 2. Navigate to the [Playground](https://dashboard.psychic.dev/playground) page to test out the connector
You can test out what your users will see from the Playground. The playground can also be used to connect to your own data using Psychic.

Enter a Connection ID that uniquely identifies the Notion workspace you're trying to connect to. In production, the Connection ID should be unique for every (user, data source) tuple. For example, if one of your users with ID `1234` connects to Notion, you can use something like `1234+notion` to uniquely identify the connection

Press `Connect` and follow the steps in the Psychic Link modal. Choose which pages from your Notion workspace you want to ingest.

### 3. Test that you've successfully connected to your Notion workspace

Refresh the page and go to the `Active Connections` tab to see if the connection with the Connection ID you set now appears in the table. 

### 4. Fetch documents from the Notion workspace you just connected to
First you will need to get your API key from the [Psychic dashboard](https://dashboard.psychic.dev/api-keys) and use that to authorize yourself when making requests to retrieve documents through one of your connections. The secret API key should only be used from your server-side code, while the public key can be used from anywhere.

Then, visit the [API tesing page](https://sidekick-ezml2kwdva-uc.a.run.app/docs#/). Paste your API key into the `Bearer token` field in FastAPI

Use the `/get-documents` endpoint to test that you can retrieve the Notion pages you shared with Psychic. You will need to provide the Connection ID you set in step 3, as well as `notion` as the Connector ID.

## Conclusion
That's it! You've tested what it will be like for your users to connect their Notion pages with Psychic and for you to query them once connected.

### Next Steps
1. Install the [Psychic Python SDK](/python-sdk) to query your documents in python, instead of making API calls.
2. Install the [Psychic React SDK](/psychic-link) to load the Link component into your own project.
3. Check out the [LangChain tutorial](https://github.com/psychic-api/psychic-langchain-tutorial) to use Psychic to load documents into your LangChain application.
