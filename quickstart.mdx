## Background
When building AI assistants and other products with large language models, it's necessary to connect the LLM to source of knowledge.
Sometimes these can be PDFs or public facing websites, but the majority of institutional knowledge is held in data silos managed by an application.

In order to connect to these sources of knowledge, developers need to **authorize** with the application, **sync** data from the application's API, and **transform** the data into text-based documents that can be retrieved using LangChain or other LLM orchestration libraries.
Psychic lets developers do all three with a single integration, without having to familiarize themselves with the quirks of each application's auth flows, API endpoints, and data formats.

# ⚡️ Psychic Quickstart
In this quickstart, you'll set up a connection with an API of your choice, use the Psychic Python SDK to fetch documents from that API, and use LangChain/Chroma/OpenAi to set up a retrieval service to ask questions about those documents. 

We will also integrate Psychic into your application to connect to data from your user's accounts on Notion, Google Drive, or any other connector Psychic supports.
The code for this tutorial is [here](https://github.com/psychic-api/psychic-quickstart).

## Prerequisites
* Familiarity with python
* An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

## Create a connection
1. Create an account at [dashboard.psychic.dev](https://dashboard.psychic.dev)
2. Navigate to the [Create Connection](https://dashboard.psychic.dev/create-connection) page to set up a new connection. Pick any arbitrary string as the `account_id`, but be sure to remember this value.
3. Press `Connect` and follow the steps in the Psychic Link modal to establish a new connection. You'll see a confirmation message if the connection is successful.

## Fetch documents from your connection
Get your secret API key from the [Psychic dashboard](https://dashboard.psychic.dev/api-keys). 
Then, send a request to `https://api.psychic.dev/get-documents` to fetch documents from the account you just connected. If you connected to a Conversations connector (e.g. Slack), use the `/get-conversations' [endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/get-conversations) instead.

```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.psychic.dev/get-documents \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_secret_key}' \
  --data '{
  "account_id": "{account_id}"
}'
```

<Tip>You can use this API to query documents from any data source and get back results as a consistent HTML document. This means you only need to write a single HTML parser, instead of writing customer parsers for each data source.</Tip>

You can also visit the [API Docs](/api-reference/endpoint/get-documents) to test the Psychic APIs from an interactive playground.

If you see the documents you shared in the results, it means that you've successfully established an OAuth connection with Psychic, fetched data from your connected account, and normalized that data has HTML to easily parse and use with LangChain.

<Tip>You can also set `chunked=true` in your request to get back documents that are split into segments between `min_chunk_size` and `max_chunk_size`. Psychic employs a chunking strategies that attempts to keep relevant sections together.</Tip>

## Ask questions about your documents
Clone the [quickstart repo](https://github.com/psychic-api/psychic-quickstart) and following the instructions to run it.
Be sure to substitute your own OpenAI API key and Psychic secret key, as well as the `account_id` you used to create a connection.

The code:
```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
from psychicapi import Psychic, ConnectorId
from langchain.schema import Document
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain

try:
    psychic = Psychic(secret_key=os.getenv("PSYCHIC_SECRET_KEY"))
    #replace account_id with the ones you used when creating a new connection at https://dashboard.psychic.dev/playground
    psychic_docs = psychic.get_documents(account_id="account_id", chunked=True)
    docs = [
        Document(page_content=doc["content"], metadata={"title": doc["title"], "source": doc["uri"]})
        for doc in psychic_docs
    ]

    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
    vdb = Chroma.from_documents(docs, embeddings)
    while True:
        question = input("✨ Ask a question: ")
        chain = RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain.from_chain_type(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type="stuff", retriever=vdb.as_retriever())
        answer = chain({"question": question}, return_only_outputs=True)
        print(answer)
        print("")
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

## Add the Link component to your application
In order for your users to connect their own documents, you will need to trigger the modal you used for OAuth in step 1 from your application.
There are two ways to do this:

### As a React hook
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { usePsychicLink } from '@psychic-api/link';

const PsychicDemo: React.FC = () => {
  const [connection, setConnection] = useState(null)
  const { open, isReady, isLoading, error } = usePsychicLink(publicKey, psychicCallback) // publicKey is your Psychic public key
  const accountId = getUserId()
  
  const psychicCallback = (newConnection) => {
    setConnection(newConnection)
    fetchDocumentsFromServer(newConnection.accountId, newConnection.connectorId) // Optional. Send a request to your backend to fetch documents using the Psychic API endpoints or Python library.
  }
  return (
    <button onClick={() => {
      open(accountId)
    }} >
      Connect
    </button>
  )
}
```
For  more details refer to the [Link docs](/psychic-link).

### As a magic link
You can send a shareable link to your users that allows them to create new connections. This is helpful if you aren't sure who in your customer's organization has the right permissions.

The url takes this format: `https://link.psychic.dev/?public_key={public_key}&account_id={account_id}`.
* `public_key` is the Public Key you can copy from https://dashboard.psychic.dev/api-keys
* `account_id` is a unique ID to identify each group of connections. Typically this is the unique user id you use in your application. This should NOT be a secret or contain PII (e.g. an email).

## Set up syncs
You can fetch these documents when needed from your application by making requests to the `/get-documents` or `/get-conversations` endpoint, depending on the data source.
The Psychic [python SDK](/psychic-sdk) provides a convenient wrapper around thse API calls.

It's also possible to set up a webhook from the [Syncs page](https://dashboard.psychic.dev/syncs) to receive all documents from every connector on a 24 hour schedule. Requests to the webhook will include a body with the following schema:
```json
{
  'account_id': string,
  'connector_id': string,
  'documents': [{
    'title': string
    'content': string
    'connector_id': string
    'account_id': string
    'uri' string (optional)
  }]
}
```

## Next Steps
Now you know how to:
1. Establish new connections with your users' accounts
2. Fetch data from those accounts and convert it to HTML documents
3. Connect documents to a LangChain application
4. Poll Psychic's API to get documents when needed or set up webhooks to fetch documents automatically

You have everything you need to integrate your user's siloed data with your LangChain application.
