## Sidekick Pull
You can use the `/get-documents` endpoint to pull all Document-type data from the connections your customers have established.


### 1. Get Secret API Key
Get your secret key from the [Sidekick dashboard](https://dashboard.getsidekick.ai/api-keys). This is used to authenticate requests from your server.

### 2. Make a request from a server
Make an http request to `https://sidekick-ezml2kwdva-uc.a.run.app/get_documents` with your secret key as the bearer token, and with the following body:

```json
{
  "connector_id": "notion",
  "connection_id": "user99_notion"
}
```

You can also test out document fetching from our [API playground](https://sidekick-ezml2kwdva-uc.a.run.app/docs#/default/get_documents_get_documents_post).

## Future
* Sidekick Push: define an endpoint to receive data, instead of having to poll for data.
* Webhooks: get pushed data only when changes are detected.
* Incremental syncs: receive only incremental changes to your customers resources, instead of all resources every time.
